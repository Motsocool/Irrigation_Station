# Irrigation_Station
Pico W Webpage controlling Lawn Irrigation used with a Pico Relay B from Waveshare.

Planning to make the toggles activate timers, add an overall toggle to start a squence of timers, make this webpage remotely accessible, 
add an lcd that displays the voltage, current zone watering, and the ip address of the pico w, 
and maybe an sms system for notifying if the lawn is over due for watering and if one zone has been on too long.

find me at tmntnpizza at reddit if you want to get into conact with me. please let me know if you see or create a cod ethat may help me to complete this project!
